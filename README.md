This repository contains a simple Perl script that demonstrates a division by zero error. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero using a conditional statement.  The error highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in Perl programs.
